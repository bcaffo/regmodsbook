# Multivariable regression analysis
[Watch this before beginning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsXtdSNbg5E&index=19&list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC)

In this chapter we extend linear regression so that our models
can contain more variables. A natural first approach is to assume
additive effects, basically extending our linear model to a plane
or hyperplane. This technique represents one of the most widely
used and successful methods in statistics.

### Multivariable regression analyses: adjustment
If I were to present evidence of a relationship between
breath mint useage (mints per day, X) and pulmonary function
(measured in FEV), you would be skeptical.
Likely, you would say, 'smokers tend to use more breath mints than non smokers, smoking is related to a loss in pulmonary function. That's probably the culprit.'
If asked what would convince you, you would likely say, 'If non-smoking breath mint users had lower lung function than non-smoking non-breath mint users and, similarly, if smoking breath mint users had lower lung function than smoking non-breath mint users, I'd be more inclined to believe you'.
In other words, to even consider my results, I would have to demonstrate that they hold while holding smoking status fixed.

This is one of the main uses of multivariate regression, to consider a relationship
between a predictor and response, while accounting for other variables.

### Multivariable regression analyses: prediction
An insurance company is interested in how last year's claims can predict a person's time in the hospital this year. They want to use an enormous amount of data contained in claims to predict a single number. Simple linear regression is not equipped to handle more than one predictor.
How can one generalize SLR to incorporate lots of regressors for the purpose of prediction?
What are the consequences of adding lots of regressors? Surely there must be consequences to throwing variables in that aren't related to Y? Surely there must also be consequences to omitting variables that are?

## The linear model
The general linear model extends simple linear regression (SLR)
by adding terms linearly into the model.

{$$}
Y_i =  \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \ldots +
\beta_{p} X_{pi} + \epsilon_{i}
= \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \beta_j + \epsilon_{i}
{/$$}

Here {$$}X_{1i}=1{/$$} typically, so that an intercept is included.
Least squares (and hence ML estimates under iid Gaussianity
of the errors) minimizes:

{$$}
\sum_{i=1}^n \left(Y_i - \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ki} \beta_j\right)^2
{/$$}

Note, the important linearity is linearity in the coefficients.
Thus

{$$}
Y_i =  \beta_1 X_{1i}^2 + \beta_2 X_{2i}^2 + \ldots +
\beta_{p} X_{pi}^2 + \epsilon_{i}
{/$$}

is still a linear model. We've just squared the elements of the
predictor variables.

## Estimation

[Watch this before beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbsDGRLhluA&index=20&list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC)

Recall, the LS estimate for regression through the origin is,

{$$}E[Y_i]=X_{1i}\beta_1{/$$}, was {$$}\sum X_i Y_i / \sum X_i^2.{/$$}

Let's consider two regressors, {$$}E[Y_i] = X_{1i}\beta_1 + X_{2i}\beta_2 = \mu_i{/$$}.
Least squares tries to minimize:

{$$}
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_{1i} \beta_1 - X_{2i} \beta_2)^2
{/$$}

We describe fitting with two regressors using residuals, since it will help
us to understand how multivariable regression adjusts an effect for another
variable. The result is that the estimate for {$$}\beta_1{/$$} is:

{$$}\hat \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n e_{i, Y | X_2} e_{i, X_1 | X_2}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e_{i, X_1 | X_2}^2},{/$$}


where, {$$}e_{i, Y|X_2}{/$$} is the residual having fit {$$}X_2{/$$} on {$$}Y{/$$}
and {$$}e_{i, X_1|X_2}{/$$} is the residual having fit {$$}X_2{/$$} on {$$}Y{/$$}.
That is, the regression estimate for {$$}\beta_1{/$$} is the regression
through the origin estimate having regressed {$$}X_2{/$$} out of both
the response and the predictor. Similarly, the regression estimate for
{$$}\beta_2{/$$} is the regression  through the origin estimate having regressed
{$$}X_1{/$$} out of both the response and the predictor.

More generally, multivariate regression estimates are exactly those having removed the linear relationship of the other variables from both the regressor and response.
This demonstrates the sense in which multivariate regression variables *adjust*
for the effect of the other variables.

## Example with two variables, simple linear regression

We already have one of the most important examples of two variables down, linear
regression. The linear regression model is:

{$$}Y_{i} = \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i}{/$$}

where  {$$}X_{2i} = 1{/$$} is an intercept term. Let's double check our
rule, since we already know what the least squares estimates are in this case.


Notice the fitted coefficient of {$$}X_{2i}{/$$} on {$$}Y_{i}{/$$} is
{$$}\bar Y{/$$}, the mean of the Ys.  Then the residuals are
{$$}e_{i, Y | X_2} = Y_i - \bar Y{/$$}.

Similarly, the fitted coefficient of {$$}X_{2i}{/$$} on {$$}X_{1i}{/$$}
is {$$}\bar X_1{/$$}. Then, the residuals are
{$$}e_{i, X_1 | X_2}= X_{1i} - \bar X_1{/$$}.

Thus let's work out the estimate for {$$}\beta_1{/$$}:

{$$}
\hat \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n e_{i, Y | X_2} e_{i, X_1 | X_2}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e_{i, X_1 | X_2}^2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)(Y_i - \bar Y)}{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2}
= Cor(X, Y) \frac{Sd(Y)}{Sd(X)}
{/$$}

This agrees with the estimate that we came up with before.

## The general case
In the general case with {$$}p{/$$} regressors,
least squares solutions have to minimize:

{$$}
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_{1i}\beta_1 - \ldots - X_{pi}\beta_p)^2
{/$$}

The least squares estimate for the coefficient of a multivariate regression model is exactly regression through the origin with the linear relationships with the other regressors removed from both the regressor and outcome by taking residuals.
In this sense, multivariate regression "adjusts" a coefficient for the linear impact of the other variables.

Of course, we don't fit multivariate regression models in this way
ever in practice, we rely on software like `lm`. In fact, the
programs that fit multivariate regression don't do it this way either. However,
thinking in the terms of residuals is the most conceptually useful way to think about what multivariate regression is accomplishing.

## Simulation demonstrations

[Watch this video demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJJxyJ6PC6I&list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC&index=21)

Let's do some simulation exercises to convince ourselves how multivariable
regression works.

### Linear model with three variables

{line-numers=off,lang=r}
~~~
> n = 100; x = rnorm(n); x2 = rnorm(n); x3 = rnorm(n)
## Generate the data
> y = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + rnorm(n, sd = .1)
## Get the residuals having removed X2 and X3 from X1 and Y
> ey = resid(lm(y ~ x2 + x3))
> ex = resid(lm(x ~ x2 + x3))
## Fit regression through the origin with the residuals
> sum(ey * ex) / sum(ex ^ 2)
[1] 1.009
## Double check with lm
> coef(lm(ey ~ ex - 1))
    ex
1.009
## Fit the full linear model to show that it agrees
coef(lm(y ~ x + x2 + x3))
(Intercept)           x          x2          x3
     1.0202      1.0090      0.9787      1.0064
~~~
You can see that the estimate, 1.009, is obtained by the recipe we outlined;
and it agrees with the function `lm` produces for us.

## Interpretation of the coefficients

Let's go through the interpretation of the coefficients. Consider the
predicted mean for a given set of values of the regressors:

{$$}E[Y | X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_p = x_p] = \sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \beta_k.{/$$}

Now consider incrementing {$$}X_1{/$$} (and only {$$}X_1{/$$}) by 1.

{$$}
E[Y | X_1 = x_1 + 1, \ldots, X_p = x_p] = (x_1 + 1) \beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^p x_{k} \beta_k
{/$$}

Now let's subtract these two equations:

{$$}
E[Y | X_1 = x_1 + 1, \ldots, X_p = x_p]  - E[Y | X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_p = x_p]
= (x_1 + 1) \beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^p x_{k} \beta_k - \sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \beta_k = \beta_1
{/$$}

Thus, the interpretation of a multivariate regression coefficient is the expected change in the response per unit change in the regressor, holding all of the other regressors fixed.
The latter part of the phrase is important, by holding the other regressors
constant, we are investigating an adjusted effect, just like we described in the
smoking and breath mint useage example at the beginning of the chapter.

In the next chapter, we'll do examples and go over context-specific
interpretations.

## Fitted values, residuals and residual variation
All of our simple linear regression quantities can be extended to linear models.
Here we list them out in one place. Our statistical model is:

{$$}Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \beta_{k} + \epsilon_{i}{/$$}

where {$$}\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2){/$$}.
Our fitted responses are:

{$$}\hat Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \hat \beta_{k}.{/$$}

We can define our residuals exactly as in linear regression:

{$$}e_i = Y_i - \hat Y_i{/$$}

Our variance estimate is.

{$$}\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-p} \sum_{i=1}^n e_i ^2{/$$}

To get predicted responses at new values, {$$}x_1, \ldots, x_p{/$$},
simply plug them into the linear model {$$}\sum_{k=1}^p x_{k} \hat \beta_{k}{/$$}.

Coefficients have standard errors, we can label them as
{$$}\hat \sigma_{\hat \beta_k}{/$$}, and

{$$}\frac{\hat \beta_k - \beta_k}{\hat \sigma_{\hat \beta_k}}{/$$}

follows a t distribution with {$$}n-p{/$$} degrees of freedom.
Predicted responses have standard errors and we can calculate predicted
and expected response intervals.
