# Residuals, variation, diagnostics

## Residuals


Recall from Chapter 6 that the vertical distances between the observed data points and the fitted
regression line are called residuals. We can generalize this idea to the vertical distances between
the observed data and the fitted surface in multivariable settings.

To be specific, recall our linear models, which was
specified as {$$}Y_i =  \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \beta_j + \epsilon_{i}{/$$}. Throughout this lecture,
we'll also assume that {$$}\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2){/$$}, even though this assumption isn't
necessary for the definition of the residuals.

We define the residuals as:

{$$}e_i = Y_i -  \hat Y_i =  Y_i - \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik} \hat \beta_j. {/$$}

This definition is identical ({$$}Y_i - \hat Y_i{/$$}) to our definition in the linear regression case.
The residuals are the vertical distances between the observed data points and the fitted regression surface.
Just like in linear regression, our estimate of residual variation is basically the average of the squared
residuals. Specifically, {$$}\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-p}{/$$}. Just like the before, we divide
by {$$}n-p{/$$} rather than {$$}n{/$$} so that the estimate is unbiased, {$$}E[\hat \sigma^2] = \sigma^2{/$$}.


Obtaining and plotting residuals in R is particularly easy. The function `resid` will return the residuals of a model
fit with `lm`. Some useful plots, including a residual plot, can be performed with the `plot` function on the output
of a `lm` fit.   Consider the `swiss` dataset from previous chapters.

{lang=r, line-numbers=off}
~~~
data(swiss); par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
fit <- lm(Fertility ~ . , data = swiss); plot(fit)
~~~

Consider the upper left hand plot of the residuals ({$$}e_i{/$$}) versus
the fitted values ({$$}\hat Y_i{/$$}). Often, a horizontal reference line at 0 is drawn
since (whenever an intercept is included) the residuals must sum to 0 and
so will lie above and below the zero. Just like in our previous residual
plots, one is look for any systematic patters or large outlying observations.

Note that this is one of many residual plots that one may be interested in
performing. For example, one might want to look at plots of residuals by
individual predictors or, as is done by `plot`, versus leverage (defined
  later in this chapter).


## Influential, high leverage and outlying points

As previously mentioned, it is a good idea to check our data for outliers.
We may want to refer back to these points to see if we can ascertain how
they became outliers, such as a misrecording. In addition, we may want
to fit the models with and without those points included in order to
ascertain their influence on the model fit and inferential goals.

Outliers can results for a variety of reasons. They can be real, but
inconvenient, data. They could arise from spurious processes like
processing or recording errors. They can have varying degrees of
influence on our model. Thus, calling a point an outlier is vague and
we need a more precise language to discuss points that fall outside of
our cloud of data. The plot below is useful for understanding different
sorts of outliers.

![Plot of simulated data with four different kinds of highlighted orange points.](images/mresid2.png)


The lower left hand point is not an outlier having neither leverage nor
influence on our fitted model. The upper left hand point
is an outlier in the Y direction, but not in the X. It will have little
impact on our fitted model, since there's lots of X points nearby
to counteract its effect. This point is said to have
low leverage and influence. The upper right hand
point is outside of the range of X values and Y values, but conforms
nicely to the regression relationship. This point has  It will also have little effect
on the fitted model. It has high leverage, but chooses not to exert it,
and thus has low influence. The lower left hand point is outside of the range
of X values, but not the Y values. However, it does not conform to the
relationship of the remainder of points at all. This outlier has high leverage and influence.


From this discussion you can maybe guess at the formal definition of
two important terms: leverage and influence.
Leverage discusses how outside of the norm a points X values
are from the cloud of other X values. A point with high leverage has the
opportunity to dramatically impact the regression model. Whether or not
it does so depends on how closely it conforms to the fit.

The other concept, influence, is a measure of how much impact a point has
on the regression fit. The most direct way to measure influence is
fit the model with the point included and excluded.




## Residuals, Leverage and Influence measures

[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/b6iqeHs_iro)

Now that we understand the three concepts of residuals, leverage and influence, we present a laundry list
of probes.  Do `?influence.measures` to see the full suite of influence measures in stats.  

First consider **residuals**. We already know if `fit` is the output of
`lm` (as in `fit = lm(y ~ x1 + x2)`), then `resid(fit)` returns the
ordinary residuals. A problem, though, is that these are defined as
{$$}Y_i - \hat Y_i {/$$} and thus have the units of the outcome. This
isn't great for comparing residual values across different analyses
with different experiments. So, some efforts to standardize residuals
have been made. Two of the most common are:

* `rstandard` - residuals divided by their standard deviations
* `rstudent` - residuals divided by their standard deviations, where the ith data point was deleted in the calculation of the standard deviation for the residual to follow a t distribution

Both of these endeavor to create T-like (as in Student's T distribution)
statistics so that one can threshold residuals using T cutoffs. This is
why these sorts of residuals are called `studentized`. The `rstudent`
residuals are exactly T distributed while the `rstandard` is not. The
`rstandard` residuals are sometimes called internally standardized while the
`rstudent` are called externally. The distinction between the residuals
is mostly for establishing probability based cutoffs. Instead, we recommend
looking at the residuals as a collective and using the cutoffs loosely.
Under this way of thinking,
the distinctions over which of these two kinds of standardization are used
is more academic than practical.

A common use for residuals is to diagnose normality of the errors. This
is often done by plotting the residual quantiles versus normal quantiles.
This is called a residual QQ plot. Your residuals should fall roughly
on a line if plotted in a normal QQ plot. There is of course noise and
a perfect fit would not be expected even if the model held.

**Leverage** is largely measured by one quantity, so called *hat diagonals*, which can be obtained in R by the function `hatvalues`. The
hat values are necessarily between 0 and 1 with larger values indicating
greater (potential for) leverage.

After leverage, there are quite a few ways to probe for **influence. These
are:

  * `dffits` - change in the predicted response when the $i^{th}$ point is deleted in fitting the model.
  * `dfbetas` - change in individual coefficients when the $i^{th}$ point is deleted in fitting the model.
  * `cooks.distance` - overall change in the coefficients when the $i^{th}$ point is deleted.

In other words, the `dffits` check for influence in the fitted values,
`dfbetas` check for influence in the coefficients individually and `cooks.distance` checks for influence in the coefficients as a collective.

Finally, there's a residual measure that's also an influence measure.
Particularly, consider `resid(fit) / (1 - hatvalues(fit))` where `fit` is the linear model fit. This is the so-called PRESS residuals. These
are the residual error from leave one out cross validation. That is, the difference in the response and the predicted response at data point {$$}i{/$$}, where it was not included in the model fitting.

### How do I use all of these things?

First of all, be wary of simplistic rules for diagnostic plots and measures. The use of these tools is context specific. It's better to understand what they are trying to accomplish and use them judiciously. Not all diagnostics measures have meaningful absolute scales. You can look at them relative to the values across the data. Even for the ones with known
exact distributions to establish cutoffs,
those distributions (like the externally studentized residual) have degrees of freedom that depend on the sample size, so a single threshold can't
be used across all settings.

A better way to think about these tool is as diagnostics, like a
physician diagnosing a health issue. These tools probe your data in different ways to diagnose different problems.  Some examples include:
  * Patterns in your residual plots generally indicate some poor aspect of model fit.
  * Heteroskedasticity (non constant variance).
  * Missing model terms.
  * Temporal patterns (plot residuals versus collection order).
* Residual QQ plots investigate normality of the errors.
* Leverage measures (hat values) can be useful for diagnosing data entry errors and points that have a high potential for influence.
* Influence measures get to the bottom line, 'how does deleting or including this point impact a particular aspect of the model'.

Let's do some experiments to see how these measure hold up.

## Simulation examples

### Case 1

In what follows, we're going to try several simulation settings and see the values of some
on the residuals, influence measures and leverage. In our first
case, we simulate 100 points. The 101st point, `c(10, 10)`,
has created a strong regression relationship where there shouldn't be one.
Note we prepend this point at the beginning of the Y and X vectors.


{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
n <- 100; x <- c(10, rnorm(n)); y <- c(10, c(rnorm(n)))
plot(x, y, frame = FALSE, cex = 2, pch = 21, bg = "lightblue", col = "black")
abline(lm(y ~ x))
~~~


<div class="rimage center"><img src="fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" class="plot" /></div>


First, let's look at the `dfbetas`. Note the `dfbetas` are 101 by 2 dimensional, since there's a `dfbeta`
for both the intercept and the slope. Let's just output the first 10 for the slope.

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
> fit <- lm(y ~ x)
> round(dfbetas(fit)[1 : 10, 2], 3)
     1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10
 6.007 -0.019 -0.007  0.014 -0.002 -0.083 -0.034 -0.045 -0.112 -0.008
~~~

Clearly the first point has a much, much larger `dfbeta` for the slope than
the other points. That is, the slope changes dramatically from when we include
this point to not including it. Try it out with Cook's distance and the
`dffits`. Let's look at leverage.


{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
round(hatvalues(fit)[1 : 10], 3)
    1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10
0.445 0.010 0.011 0.011 0.030 0.017 0.012 0.033 0.021 0.010
~~~

Again, this point has a much higher leverage value than that of
the other points. By having a large leverage value and
`dfbeta`, we're seeing that this point has a high potential for influence, and
decided to exert it.


### Case 2

Consider a second case where the point lies on a natural
line defined by the data, but is well outside of the cloud
of X values. Since the code is so similar, I don't show it.
But, as always, it can be found in the github repo for the
courses.

![Second simulation example.](images/mresid4.png)

Now let's consider the `dfbetas` and the leverage for the
first 10 observations.

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
> round(dfbetas(fit2)[1 : 10, 2], 3)
     1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10
-0.072 -0.041 -0.007  0.012  0.008 -0.187  0.017  0.100 -0.059  0.035
> round(hatvalues(fit2)[1 : 10], 3)
    1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10
0.164 0.011 0.014 0.012 0.010 0.030 0.017 0.017 0.013 0.021
~~~

As we would expect, the `dfbeta` value for the first point is well with
the range of the other points. The leverage is much larger than the others.
In this case, the point has high leverage, but choses not to exert it as influence.

Play around with more simulation examples to get a feeling for what these
measures do. This will help more than anything in understanding their
value.

## Example described by Stefanski

[Watch this video before beginning.](http://youtu.be/oMW7jGEdZ48)

We end with a really fun example from Stefanski in [TAS 2007 volume 61](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/000313007X190079).
This paper illustrates how a residual plot can unveil hidden treasures that would be nearly
impossible to detect with other kinds of plots. He has several examples on his website
and we go through one. First, let's read in the data and do a scatterplot matrix.


{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
dat <- read.table('http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~stefanski/NSF_Supported/Hidden_Images/orly_owl_files/orly_owl_Lin_4p_5_flat.txt', header = FALSE)
pairs(dat)
~~~

![Scatterplot matrix from the Stefanski data.](images/mresid5.png)

It looks like a big mess of nothing. We can fit a model and get
that all of the variables are highly significant

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
> summary(lm(V1 ~ . -1, data = dat))$coef
   Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
V2   0.9856    0.12798   7.701 1.989e-14
V3   0.9715    0.12664   7.671 2.500e-14
V4   0.8606    0.11958   7.197 8.301e-13
V5   0.9267    0.08328  11.127 4.778e-28
~~~

Can we call it a day? Let's check a residual plot.

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
fit <- lm(V1 ~ . - 1, data = dat); plot(predict(fit), resid(fit), pch = '.')
~~~

![Residuals versus fitted values from the Stefanski data.](images/mresid6.png)

There appears to be a pattern. The moral of the story here is that residual plots
can really hone in on systematic patters in the data that are completely non-apparent
from other plots.

## Exercises

1. Load the dataset `Seatbelts` as part of the `datasets` package via `data(Seatbelts)`. Use
`as.data.frame` to convert the object to a dataframe. Fit a linear model of driver deaths
with `kms`, `PetrolPrice` and `law` as predictors.
2. Refer to question 1. Directly estimate the residual variation via the function `resid`. Compare with R's residual variance estimate. [Watch a video solution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8nPIeH1rwU&list=PLpl-gQkQivXji7JK1OP1qS7zalwUBPrX0&index=44)
