## Residual variation
Residuals represent variation left unexplained by our model. We emphasize the
difference between residuals and errors. The errors unobservable true errors
from the known coefficients, while residuals are the observable errors from
the estimated coefficients. In a sense, the residuals are estimates of the
errors.

Consider again the `diamond` data set from `UsingR`. Recall that
the data is diamond prices (Singapore dollars) and diamond weight
in carats (standard measure of diamond mass, 0.2 $g$).
To get the data use `library(UsingR); data(diamond)`. Recall the data
and our linear regression fit looked like the following:

![Diamond data plotted along with best fitting regression line.](images/diamond1.png)

Recall our linear model was

{$$}Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i{/$$}

where we are assuming that {$$}\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2){/$$}.
Our observed outcome is {$$}Y_i{/$$} with associated
predictor value, {$$}X_i{/$$}.  Let's label the predicted outcome
for index {$$}i{/$$} as {$$}\hat Y_i{/$$}. Recall that we obtain
our predictions by plugging our observed {$$}X_i{/$$} into the
linear regression equation:

{$$}
\hat Y_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 X_i
{/$$}

The residual is defined as the difference the between the observed and predicted outcome

{$$}
e_i = Y_i - \hat Y_i.
{/$$}

The residuals are exactly the vertical distance between the observed data point
and the associated point on the regression line. Positive residuals have associated
Y values above the fitted line and negative residuals have values below.

![Picture of the residuals for the diamond data. Residuals are the signed length
of the red lines.](images/resid1.png)

Least squares minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, {$$}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2{/$$}.
Note that the {$$}e_i{/$$} are observable, while the errors, {$$}\epsilon_i{/$$} are
not. The residuals can be thought of as estimates of the errors.

## Properties of the residuals
Let's consider some properties of the residuals.
First, under our model, their expected value is 0,  {$$}E[e_i] = 0{/$$}.
If an intercept is included, {$$}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = 0{/$$}. Note this tells
us that the residuals are not independent. If we know {$$}n-1{/$$} of them,
we know the {$$}n^{th}{/$$}. In fact, we will only have {$$}n-p{/$$} free
residuals, where {$$}p{/$$} is the number of coefficients in our regression model,
so {$$}p=2{/$$} for linear regression with an intercept and slope.
If a regressor variable, {$$}X_i{/$$}, is included in the model
then {$$}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i X_i = 0{/$$}.

What do we use residuals for? Most importantly,
residuals are useful for investigating poor model fit.
Residual plots highlight poor model fit.


Another use for residuals is to create covariate adjusted variables. Specifically,
residuals can be thought of as the outcome (Y) with the
linear association of the predictor (X) removed. So, for example, if you wanted
to create a weight variable with the linear effect of height removed, you would
fit a linear regression with weight as the outcome and height as the predictor
and take the residuals. (Note this only works if the relationship is linear.)

Finally, we should note the different sorts of variation one encounters in regression.
There's the total variability in our response, usually called total variation.
One then differentiates residual variation (variation after removing
the predictor) from systematic variation (variation explained by the regression model).
These two kinds of variation add up to the total variation, which we'll see later.

## Example

The code below shows how to obtain the residuals.

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
> data(diamond)
> y <- diamond$price; x <- diamond$carat; n <- length(y)
> fit <- lm(y ~ x)
## The easiest way to get the residuals
> e <- resid(fit)
## Obtain the residuals manually, get the predicted Ys first
> yhat <- predict(fit)
## The residuals are y - yhat. Let's check by comparing this
## with R's build in resid function
> max(abs(e -(y - yhat)))
[1] 9.486e-13
## Let's do it again hard coding the calculation of Yhat
max(abs(e - (y - coef(fit)[1] - coef(fit)[2] * x)))
[1] 9.486e-13

### Residuals versus X

A useful plot is the residuals versus the X values. This allows us to
zoom in on instances of poor model fit.
Whenever we look at a residual plot, we are searching for systematic patterns
of any sort.  Here's the plot for diamond data.

![Plot of the mass (horizontal) versus residuals (vertical)](images/resid2.png)


Let's go through some more contrived examples to highlight
Here's a plot of nonlinear data where we've fit a line.

![Plot of simulated non-linear data.](images/resid3.png)

Here's what happens when you focus in on the residuals.

![Plot of residuals versus X](images/resid4.png)

Another common feature where our model fails is when the variance around
the regression line is not constant. Remember our errors are assumed to be
Gaussian with a constant error.  Here's an example where heteroskedasticity
is not at all apparent in the scatterplot.

![Scatterplot demonstrating heteroskedasticity.](images/resid5.png)

Now look at the consequences of focusing in on the residuals.

If we look at the residual plot for the diamond data, things don't look so bad.

## Estimating residual variation
[Watch this before beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE3a4OZFWPA&list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC&index=15)

We've talked at length about how to estimate {$$}\beta_0{/$$} and {$$}\beta_1{/$$}.
However, there's another parameter in our model, {$$}\sigma{/$$}.
Recall that our model is {$$}Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i{/$$},
where {$$}\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2){/$$}.

It seems natural to use our residual variation to estimate population
error variation.
In fact, the maximum likelihood estimate of {$$}\sigma^2{/$$} is
{$$}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2{/$$}, the average squared residual. Since
the residuals have a zero mean (if an intercept is included), this is close
to the the calculating the variance of the residuals. However, to obtain
unbiasedness, most people use

{$$}
\hat \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2.
{/$$}

The {$$}n-2{/$$} instead of {$$}n{/$$} is so that {$$}E[\hat \sigma^2] = \sigma^2{/$$}.
This is exactly analogous to dividing by {$$}n-1{/$$} in the ordinary variance
calculation. In fact, the ordinary variance (using `var` in R on a vector) is
exactly the same as the residual variance estimate from a model that has an
intercept and no slope. The {$$}n-2{/$$} instead of {$$}n-1{/$$} when we
include a slope can be thought of as losing a degree of freedom from having
to estimate an extra parameter (the slope).

Most of this is typically opaque to the user, since we just grab the correct
residual variance output from `lm`. But, to solidify the concepts, let's
go through the diamond example to make sure that we can hard code the estimates
on our own. (And from then on we'll just use `lm`.)

### Diamond example

## Summarizing variation

A way to think about regression is in the decomposition of variability of
our response. The total variability in our response is the variability
around an intercept. This is also the variance estimate from a model with
only an intercept:

{$$}\mbox{Total variability}=\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2{/$$}

The regression variability is the variability that is explained by adding the
predictor. Mathematically, this is:

{$$}\mbox{Regression variabilty} = \sum_{i=1}^n  (\hat Y_i - \bar Y)^2{/$$}.

The residual variability is what's leftover around the regression line

{$$}\mbox{Residual variability} = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat Y_i)^2{/$$}

It's a nice fact that the error and regression variability add up to the
total variability:

{$$}
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2
= \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat Y_i)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n  (\hat Y_i - \bar Y)^2
{/$$}

Thus, we can think of regression as explaining away variability. The fact
that all of the quantities are positive and that they add up this way allows
us to define the proportion of the total variability explained by the model.

Consider our diamond example again. The plot below shows the variation
explained by a model with an intercept only (representing
  total variation) and that when the mass is included as a linear predictor.
Notice how much the variation decreases when including the diamond mass.

Here's the code:

{lang=r,line-numbers=off}
~~~
e = c(resid(lm(price ~ 1, data = diamond)),
      resid(lm(price ~ carat, data = diamond)))
fit = factor(c(rep("Itc", nrow(diamond)),
               rep("Itc, slope", nrow(diamond))))
g = ggplot(data.frame(e = e, fit = fit), aes(y = e, x = fit, fill = fit))
g = g + geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", size = 2, stackdir = "center", binwidth = 20)
g = g + xlab("Fitting approach")
g = g + ylab("Residual price")
g
~~~

example.](images/resid8.png)


## R squared
**R squared** is the percentage of the total variability that is explained
by the linear relationship with the predictor

{$$}
R^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n  (\hat Y_i - \bar Y)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar Y)^2}
{/$$}

Here are some summary notes about R squared.

* {$$}R^2{/$$} is the percentage of variation explained by the regression model.
* {$$}0 \leq R^2 \leq 1{/$$}
* {$$}R^2{/$$} is the sample correlation squared
* {$$}R^2{/$$} can be a misleading summary of model fit.
  * Deleting data can inflate it.
  * (For later.) Adding terms to a regression model always increases {$$}R^2{/$$}.


Anscombe's residual (named after their inventor)
are  a famous example of our R squared doesn't tell the whole story
about model fit.  In this example, four data sets have equivalent R squared
values and beta values, but dramatically different model fits. The result is to suggest
that reducing data to a single number, be it R squared, a test statistic
or a P-value, often masks important aspects of the data.
The code is quite simple: `data(anscombe);example(anscombe)`.
