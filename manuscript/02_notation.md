## Some basic definitions

In this chapter, we'll cover some basic definitions and notation used throughout the
book.  We will try to minimize the amount of mathematics required so that we
can focus on the concepts.

## Notation for data
We write {$$}X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n{/$$} to describe {$$}n{/$$} data points.
As an example, consider the data set {$$}\{1, 2, 5\}{/$$} then
{$$}X_1 = 1{/$$}, {$$}X_2 = 2{/$$}, {$$}X_3 = 5{/$$} and {$$}n = 3{/$$}.

Of course, there's nothing in particular about the varianble {$$}X{/$$}.
We often use a different letter, such as {$$}Y_1, \ldots , Y_n{/$$} to describe
a data set. We will typically use Greek letters for things we don't know.
Such as, {$$}\mu{/$$} being a population mean that we'd like to estimate.

## The empirical mean

The empirical mean is a measure of center of our data. Under sampling assumptions,
it estimates a population mean of interest. Define the empirical mean as

{$$}
\bar X = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i.
{/$$}

Notice if we subtract the mean from data points, we get data that has mean 0. That is, if we define

{$$}
\tilde X_i = X_i - \bar X.
{/$$}

then the mean of the {$$}\tilde X_i{/$$} is 0.
This process is called **centering** the random variables.
Recall from the previous lecture that the empirical mean is
the least squares solution for minimizing

{$$}
  \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2
{/$$}


## The emprical standard deviation and variance

The variance and standard deviation are measures of how spread out are data is.
Under sampling assumptions, they estimate variability in the population.
We define the empirical variance asL

{$$}
S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X)^2
= \frac{1}{n-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n \bar X ^ 2 \right)
{/$$}

The empirical standard deviation is defined as
{$$}S = \sqrt{S^2}.{/$$}

Notice that the standard deviation has the same units as the data.
The data defined by {$$}X_i / s{/$$} have empirical standard deviation 1.
This is called **scaling** the data.

## Normalization

We can combine centering and scaling of data as follows to get normalized data.
In particular, the data defined by:

{$$}
Z_i = \frac{X_i - \bar X}{s}
{/$$}

have empirical mean zero and empirical standard deviation 1.
The process of centering then scaling the data is called **normalizing** the data.
Normalized data are centered at 0 and have units equal to standard deviations of the original data.
Example, a value of 2 from normalized data means that data point was two standard deviations larger than the mean.

Normalization is very useful for creating data that comparable across experiments
by getting rid of any shifting or scaling effects.


## The empirical covariance
This class is largely considering how varaibles **covary**. This is estimated
by the empirical covariance.
Consider now when we have pairs of data, {$$}(X_i, Y_i){/$$}.
Their empirical covariance is defined as:

{$$}
Cov(X, Y) =
\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar X) (Y_i - \bar Y)
= \frac{1}{n-1}\left( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i Y_i - n \bar X \bar Y\right)
{/$$}

This measure is of limited utility, since its units are the product of
the units of the two variables. A more useful definition normalizes the two
variables first.

The **correlation** is defined as:

{$$}
Cor(X, Y) = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{S_x S_y}
{/$$}

where {$$}S_x{/$$} and {$$}S_y{/$$} are the estimates of standard deviations
for the {$$}X{/$$} observations and {$$}Y{/$$} observations, respectively. The correlation is simply the covariance of
the separately normalized X and Y data. Because the
data have been normalized, the correlation is a unit free
quantity and thus has more of a hope of being interpretable
across settings.

## Some facts about correlation
First, the order of the arguments is irrelevant {$$}Cor(X, Y) = Cor(Y, X){/$$}
Secondly, it has to be between -1 and  1, {$$}-1 \leq Cor(X, Y) \leq 1{/$$}.
Thirdly, the correlation is exactly -1 or 1 only when the observations fall
perfectly on a negatively or positively sloped line, respectively.
Fourthly, {$$}Cor(X, Y){/$$} measures the strength of the linear relationship between
the two variables, with stronger relationships as {$$}Cor(X,Y){/$$} heads towards -1 or 1.
Finally, {$$}Cor(X, Y) = 0{/$$} implies no linear relationship.
